Property "pickMaximum" is optional. It's the maximum number of object you can pick on the section.

<pick class="money" count="[RANDOM] + 5" />
<pick class="arrow" count="-1" />
<pick class="money" count="20" currency="kika" />
```
Pick an object. If the object cannot be picked (ex, the backpack is full), the object

* **objectId**: The identifier of the object to pick.
* **class**: This for counters. If you are going to pick meals (="meal") money (="money") or "arrow"
* **count**: Only if class is "meal", "money" or "arrow". Expression with the number of coins / meals

  Values can be "crown", "lune", "kika", "noble", "ren", "sheasutorq", "orla", or "ain"

### drop (execute once only)
```xml

<!-- Delete the items you have listed fourth, fifth, AND sixth on the Backpack section -->
<drop backpackItemSlots="4|5|6" />
<!-- Delete first AND last Special item -->
<drop specialItemSlots="1|last" />
```
Drop an object, or a set of objects. This rules is not used for counters (money, meals and arrows). If you want to
decrease a counter, use the "pick" rule. The "objectId" can be one or more object Id, or one of the following:

can contain the index positions (1-based), or "last" for the last item

If the optional property "restorePoint" is specified, the dropped item will can be restored with the rule "restoreInventoryState", with
the given restore point id.

### randomTable (has state) / case / randomTableIncrement
```xml
<randomTable index="0" zeroAsTen="true" >
    <pick class="money" count="[RANDOM]" />
</randomTable>

<randomTable>
    <case value="0">
        <choiceState section="sect53" set="enabled" />
    </case>
    <case from="1" to="2">
        <choiceState section="sect274" set="enabled" />
    </case>
    <case from="3" to="9">
        <choiceState section="sect316" set="enabled" />
    </case>
</randomTable>
<randomTableIncrement increment="+[BOWBONUS]" />

<test hasDiscipline="sixthsns">
    <randomTableIncrement increment="+2" />
</test>
```

The "randomTable" explains what to do when a random table link is clicked. When the link
is clicked, the inner rules to this tag will be execute. When the link is clicked, 
the number got will be saved as state of the rule.

The property "index" is needed only if there is more than one random table link on the
section. It will select the index (zero based) of the random table link to which it refers.

If the property "zeroAsTen" is "true", the zero value will be returned as ten.

The "case" rules are executed conditionally for the random number got. Other rules than
"case" are always executed. 

The "randomTableIncrement" will add a bonus to the random value picked. They are cumulative: If they are
more than one randomTableIncrement executed, all the increments will be added. For bow, use the [BOWBONUS].
This will add the combat skill bonus, plus bow object bonus

A "randomTableIncrement" with a increment="reset" will reset to zero any previous increment.

### randomNumber
```xml
<randomNumber />
```

Chooses a random number and stores it. Can be read out with [RANDOM]. Should not be used on sections with <randomTable> elements.

### test
```xml
<test not="true" hasDiscipline="anmlknsp">
    <choiceState section="sect144" set="disabled" />
</test>
```
This is used to execute rules conditionally. It will test a condition, and, if it's true,
it will run the inner rules to this tag.

If there is more than one condition on the tag, if any of them is true, the inner rules
will be executed.

* **isChoiceEnabled="sectionId"**: Is the choice for the given section enabled?
* **hasWeaponType="weaponType1|weaponType2|..."**: The player has some weapon of some of the given types?
* **hasCircle="loreCircleId"**: The player has this Lore Circle (see loreCircle.ts for codes)

Forces a jump to another section. "section" property specifies the section where to jump.

### currentWeapon

### textToChoice
```xml
<textToChoice 
    text="turn immediately to 335"
    section="sect335"
/>

Replaces a section text by a choice link. This could be needed when there is no link on the original Project AON XML

### kaiMonasteryStorage
```xml
<kaiMonasteryStorage />
```
Add a button to access to the Kai monastery stored objects. It can be added inside "equipmnt" sections only.

### executeOnce
```xml
<section id="sect269">
    <executeOnce>
        <!-- Order of rules is important here -->
        <test expression="[SPECIAL-ITEMS-ON-ACTIONCHART] == 0">
            <drop backpackItemSlots="1" />
        </test>
        <test not="true" expression="[SPECIAL-ITEMS-ON-ACTIONCHART] >= 4">
            <drop specialItemSlots="last" />
        </test>
        <test expression="[SPECIAL-ITEMS-ON-ACTIONCHART] >= 4">
            <drop specialItemSlots="4" />
        </test>
    </executeOnce>
</section>
```
Single rules as "drop" have state and they will not be re-executed. If you need the same behaviour on a set of rules, you can use 
"executeOnce"


### endurance (has state)
```xml
<endurance count="-2" toast="false" permanent="true" />
```
Increase / decrease the current player endurance.

The "toast" property is optional (default value="true"). If true, a toast will be displayed with the endurance increase / decrease.

The "permanent" property is optional (default value="false"). If true, the endurance increase / decrease is permanent.

The "enemy" property is optional (defualt value="false"). If true the endurance increase / decrease applies to the current enemy

### combatSkill (has state)
```xml
<combatSkill count="-5" toast="false" />
```
Increase / decrease the original player combat skill (permanent). 

The "toast" property is optional (default value="true"). If true, a toast will be displayed with the CS increase / decrease.

### onInventoryEvent (Event handler)
```xml
<onInventoryEvent>
    <disableCombats />
    <test currentWeapon="paidosword">
        <disableCombats disabled="false" />
    </test>
</onInventoryEvent>
```
Rules inside "onInventoryEvent" will be called when the player picks / drops some object, or the section is rendered (at the section startup).
It's not called when rules "pick" / "drop" are executed, only when the player does some action from the UI.
This rule was a big design mistake. 

### runInventoryEvent
It runs the "onInventoryEvent" event handler, if it exists on the section.

### displayIllustration
```xml
<displayIllustration section="sect131" 
    text="Illustration on section 131"
/>
```

### use
```xml
<use objectId="vialbluepills|vialbluepills2|vialbluepills3" />
```
Force use of one object. objectId is the object to use. If more than one object is specified, only the first one owned will be used.

### Special sections

There are sections (or parts of them) that cannot be described by the game rules.
In that case, they are specific implementations:

* **book2Sect238**: Cartwheel game
* **book2sect308**: Portholes game
* **book3sect88**: Javek venom test

## How rules are executed

If you are going to use the rules in you application, here come some tips about how to
implement them:

### Initial rendering

The algorithm to display a section is:

1. Render the section from the Project Aon book XML to an internal representation
2. Apply the section rules. This can modify this internal representation
3. Display the final result to the player

### Handle events

There are some event you must handle, and apply the associated rules for them:

* Combat events (turn execution, combat win / loss, etc)
* Inventory events (pick / drop objects)
* Choice selections
* Random table usage

### Rules state

There are some rules that have a state to record. Others, don't. 

#### Rules to execute once

There are some rules that have to be executed a single time, not each time the section
is rendered:

* Endurance loss
* Pick / drop some object
* etc

#### Rules with advanced state

There are rules that need to store a state:

* Meals: The meal has been done?
* Random table pick: Has been done? What result we got?
* etc
