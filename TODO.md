  * https://github.com/tonib/kaichronicles/issues/5
  * https://www.projectaon.org/es/foro3/viewtopic.php?p=27752#p27752
- Add a "random discipline" button that will randomly select the proper number of initial disciplines, as well as your bonus discipline each book from the choices remaining
- Add a Seventh-Sense-like achievement system

## Bugs

- Bugs reported on Google Play:
  * Finally, finally there's a proper LW game book app. The only problem I've noticed is that it only gives Silver Bow's bonus in the sections of book 6 that specifically mention it, and not at all 'rolls' as it is supposed to.
- You are erroneously allowed to apply multiple Alether effects per combat. You are always limited to one (the berries you can purchase in book 6 even explicitly say so).
- Action chart buttons don't work on iPad Safari
- ERROR: Book 8, sect139: 
  ```actionChartController.pick('quiver'); actionChartController.pick('quiver'); actionChartController.increaseArrows(10);```
  Sell Quiver: OBJECTS TABLE TO SELL IS NOT UPDATED !!!!

## Development / refactorings (TO DO NOW)
- Check older savegames with usageCount = undefined in section states, action chart and InventoryState
  Check also savegames from v1.6 (changes for this in ActionChart.fromObject())
- Test load previous savegame / state versions to v1.12 !!!
- In Grand Master books, if you have Psi-surge, check the bonus for Mindblast
- IMPROVE TESTING
- Change documentation about save games file format (changes in 1.12)
- Loyalty bonus for hunting should be applied to Grand Master too?

## Books erratas to report
- All book 13: Bow bonus should be +5 ???

## Other
- Allow to zoom illustrations?
- Add images to disciplines in Action Chart
- Add option to jump from one book to other (debugging, loyalty bonuses)
- FAQ: Add info about change the Random Table
- Add help for "LW club newsletter 29" setting
- Warn about permanent losses (toastr)
- Object images on book 9+: Use the current book image, if available
- Performance
- "Okay okay. Didn't know about the lone wolf series and went through the 10 programmed books in 2 days. Turns out the rest are online !!! 
   So it won't be as fast to play but I'm definitely continuing. One remark. I'd like to be able to know what was in the Kai monastery at 
   the end so I can continue with that too !"
- Suggestions and bugs on http://projectaon.proboards.com/post/43740
- Allow to select the current bow
- Toasts with images: align text when the text is multiline
- Combats should be sequential: First finish the first one, then the second, etc
- If the hunting is disabled on the current section, show it on some place (Action Chart?)
- Common performance (web):
  * Rendering performance on book 2 / sect equimpnt
- Test all books / all sections rendering. It should be valid HTML5
  (https://validator.w3.org/docs/api.html)
- Test tags <ch.* /> replacements
- Dialogs with text input: Allow to confirm with the screen keyboard ("go" button)
- Remove the "Alert" text from the message dialog (same for confirms)
- Allow to change the font size / family
  * See http://www.lalit.org/lab/javascript-css-font-detect/
- Add erratas section?
- Add illustrations index?

  ("Sommerswerd stuff", repeated rules)
